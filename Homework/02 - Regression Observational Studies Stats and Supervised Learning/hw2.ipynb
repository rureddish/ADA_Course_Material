    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you may do so, but must justify your choice.\n",
    "2. Make sure you use the `data` folder provided in the repository in read-only mode. (Or alternatively, be sure you don’t change any of the files.)\n",
    "3. Be sure to provide a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "4. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation (**in markdown**).\n",
    "5. Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "6. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the *master/main* branch. If there are multiple notebooks present, we will **not grade** anything.\n",
    "7. We will **not run your notebook for you**! Rather, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. Thus, be sure to hand in a **fully-run and evaluated notebook**. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "8. In continuation to the previous point, interactive plots, such as those generated using `plotly`, should be **strictly avoided**!\n",
    "9. Make sure to print results or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",

    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have just been hired as a data scientist at [FC Tokyo, a J1 League Japanese professional football club based in Chōfu, Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Tokyo). The company hired you to carry out a variety of data-related tasks, which will be explained in further detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your manager, Mr. Naoki Ogane, has noticed that an unusually high number of players in your team have birthdays in either April or May, so he asked you to investigate this further -- is this just a coincidence, or are players born in April or May simply better?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer Mr. Ogane's questions, you will use data from Wikipedia biographies. This is a subset of the Pantheon dataset (1). For tasks 1 to 4, you will use the file `japanese_athletes.csv.gz`. For task 5, you will use the file `all_entities.csv.gz`. Both datasets are`.csv` files with the same columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: a unique identifier per individual.\n",
    "- `name`: name of the individual.\n",
    "- `occupation`: the occupation of the individual (for `japanese_athletes.csv.gz`, these are all sports-related).\n",
    "- `gender`: gender of the athlete.\n",
    "- `alive`: flag indicating if the athlete was alive in 2020 when the dataset was collected.\n",
    "- `bplace_country`: the country where the athlete was born  (for `japanese_athletes.csv.gz`, the value here is always 'Japan').\n",
    "- `birthdate`: the date when the athlete was born.\n",
    "- `birthyear`: the year when the athlete was born.\n",
    "- `pageviews`: number of pageviews received by the athlete's page across Wikipedia language editions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1.5** Plot the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) to visualize the distribution of pageviews. Here you should use a linear scale for both the x-axis and the y-axis.\n",

    "Next, investigate the question posed by Mr. Ogane. *Why do so many Tokyo FC players have birthdays in the same month?* \n",

Therefore, you suspect that the observed pattern may have something to do with when students start school.\n",

    "You return to Mr. Ogane with your findings, which he again receives with great interest. The sharp manager, however, asks a question that ignites your curiosity: *are athletes that are born right after the school cut-off date (i.e., in April or May) simply better?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand if that is the case, you come up with a plan: the number of pageviews received by a Wikipedia page is a good way to differentiate between mildly famous athletes and truly famous ones. Thus you can do a matched analysis comparing athletes born in February or March (right before the cut-off) with athletes born in April or May (right after the cut-off); you should discard all athletes that were not born in one of these four months.\n",

    "1. were born in the same year; \n",
    "2. have the same gender; and\n",
    "3. have the same occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matching should be done 1-to-1; i.e., each athlete born in February/March should be matched to one and only one athlete born in April/May (there will naturally be some athletes left unmatched).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.1** Obtain the matched data described in the text above. Report the number of matched pairs and the number of discarded athletes. Your resulting dataframe should contain one row per athlete and an indicator variable `is_after`, which equals 1 when the athlete was born in April or May and 0 otherwise. Note that here you are doing exact matching, and not propensity score matching!\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.2** The number of pageviews is heavy-tailed, as we have seen in Task 1. Create a new column in your matched dataframe containing the natural logarithm of the number of pageviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.3** Assuming that whether the athlete is born in the two months right before the cutoff (February and March) or the two months right after (April and May) is assigned at random, use a linear regression to estimate the effect of being born after rather than before the cutoff date in the number of pageviews athletes receive. Use the log-transformed value you calculated in **4.2** as the outcome of your model (i.e., the $y$ of the regression). Report the summary of your model.\n",
